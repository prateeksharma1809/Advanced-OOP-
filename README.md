# Advanced OOP Projects - RIT Master's Coursework

This repository contains a collection of advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) projects developed as part of my homework solutions for the Master's program at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). These projects are implemented in Java and demonstrate various OOP concepts, design patterns, and software engineering principles.

## Projects Overview

Each project in this repository tackles different challenges and concepts in OOP. Here's a brief overview:

### Design Patterns Demonstrator
- **Description**: This project showcases the implementation of several design patterns including Singleton, Observer, Factory, and Strategy patterns. It simulates a real-world scenario where these patterns can be applied effectively.
- **Technologies**: Java
- **Key Concepts**: Design Patterns, Class Hierarchies, Encapsulation

### Multi-threaded Server-Client Chat Application
- **Description**: A multi-threaded chat application that allows multiple clients to connect to a server and communicate with each other in real-time.
- **Technologies**: Java, Java Sockets, Multithreading
- **Key Concepts**: Concurrency, Network Programming, Client-Server Architecture, Serialization

### Custom Data Structures
- **Description**: Implementation of custom data structures including a Linked List, Stack, Queue, and a Binary Search Tree from scratch.
- **Technologies**: Java
- **Key Concepts**: Data Structures, Recursion, Algorithm Complexity
